	<p> Our project is about testing which representation - text or graphical - is better for finding the median from a small set of numbers. <br>
		For our experiment, you will see a set of number values on your screen. Their representations will either be the number itself - for the text representation, or a bar 
		graph - for the graphical representation. You will then be asked to find the <b>median value</b> from the numbers presented. 
		The time you take to click your answer and whether your answer is right will be recorded. Each representation will go through the following: <br>
			&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;1. 3 numbers displayed on the screen <br>
			&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;2. 5 numbers displayed on the screen <br>
			&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;3. 9 numbers displayed on the screen <br>
			&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;4. 25 numbers displayed on the screen <br>
		The trials will be done in this order. 
		You will be doing 5 trials for each of these. In total, there will be 40 trials - 20 for each representation <br>
		Please check that you satisfy the following requirements before you do the test: <br>
			&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;1. Use a Desktop or a Laptop to do the trials. <br>
			&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;2. Use a mouse when doing the trials on a laptop. <br>
			&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;3. Use Google Chrome for the experiment. <br>

	<p> 
		1. You will start with the <b>Text Representation first</b>.<br>
		2. Then, proceed to do the <b>Bar Graph Representation</b>.<br>
		3. You will go through all 20 trials of one representation. The results will be displayed at the end of each representation.<br>
		4. Before you begin the trials, please make a text file as you will need to copy the results for each each representation.
			Please use the following format - <b>firstName_lastName.txt</b> - when naming the file.<br> 
		5. When you are done the trials for a representation, please take the time to copy and paste the results provided into your text file.
			You can copy the results of the two trials into one file. You will also be reminded when you should copy the results.<br>
		6. Once you are done, send the text file to <b>John Frederick Duco</b> on Slack.<br>
		7. Click the button below when you are ready.<br>
